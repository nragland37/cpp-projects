## Problem:
Your client, Webster University is coming to your design firm once again. 
They are pursuing to have you complete another project. 
They loved your Webster University History page and would like you to add in links to three pages that you will create showcasing the three oldest 
Webster University Buildings that are still in existence. 
They also would like the page to be fully controlled with an external stylesheet and not use the table layout from before.

The links to these pages can be added at the bottom of the Webster University History page under the level two heading, “Historical Webster University Buildings.” 
After that heading, your users will need some sort of description (that you will write) to introduce the users to the links they are about to access. 
Then you need to have links to the following pages (that you will create) using the template that you established previously with your midterm, 
e.g., table format, external main.css, etc.
Your links should be chronological and look similar to:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• 1905, H. Sam Priest Center for International Studies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• 1910, Music Building (formerly the Thompson House)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• 1916, Webster Hall

The content for these pages can be accessed by visiting the following URL: 
http://library.webster.edu/archives/buildings/

As discussed above, the content of your three pages must be placed into the template that you established previously. 
You must also utilize all of the content found on those pages and place it within your template. 
For example, The H. Sam Priest Center page will have one level one heading (i.e., H. Sam Priest Center for International Studies), 
three large bodies of text that are separated with level 2 headings (e.g., History, Webster University Acquisition, and References), 
and one image floated over to the right (included in your local host folder).

The only piece that you will add to all three of your pages is a breadcrumb list that will navigate the user back to the 
“Webster University History” page. For example, they will need to look like:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Webster University History > 1905, H. Sam Priest Center for International Studies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Webster University History > 1910, Music Building (formerly the Thompson House)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Webster University History > 1916, Webster Hall

The user should be able to click on the words, “Webster University History” which will take them back to the Webster University History page.

Important Note (CSS)
The styles for these three new pages and the Webster History page should be controlled by an external style sheet. 
Currently the Webster History page has the needed styles, but they are embedded. 
Add these styles to the main.css file that is already included in the "inc" folder and link the file to all 4 of the pages as an external style sheet. 
The embedded styles of the Webster History page should then be removed.
